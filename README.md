# guess-the-country
Little project I made using the restcountries API.

This project is 100% not screen-reader-friendly. Sory

### Useful links 
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). React framework for SSR and great loading speeds.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/). JS library used, of course.
* [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/). API for country flags and names.
