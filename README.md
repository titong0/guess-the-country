## Learned things
* Nextjs rendering patterns: SSG, SSR and ISR
* Reducing the size of API calls by processing them in the backend
* Custom hooks for complex state logic
* Supporting two languages (I did solve most of the language differences with icons but there are different texts)




### Useful links 
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). React framework for SSR and great loading speeds.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/). JS library used, of course.
* [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/). API for country flags and names.
* [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) I swear to god I'm never letting go of this icon library
